## About Me - Beyond the Professional Resume

I am married and have three children. We live in Eberdingen, a small town in Baden-Württemberg. I enjoy cycling, working out at the gym, playing with my children, woodworking, gardening, and home improvement projects. I also play the violin every few years and enjoy playing chess.

### My Mobile Workspace

Due to space constraints at home, I've created a unique solution - a fully equipped workspace in a camper van. This isn't my home, but rather my dedicated office that allows me to work flexibly for clients or enjoy the tranquility of nature while being productive. With a solar panel and a 2kWh battery system, I can work autonomously even on cloudy days. I prefer to work 80% remotely, but I also enjoy working with my customers and
colleagues in person. That's why I'm also happy to be at least once a month in person with my customers.

### My Work Philosophy

After 15+ years as a software developer, team lead, and architect at various companies, I've been working as a freelancer for the past 3 years. I thrive in collaborative team environments where I can contribute my experience while continuing to learn. I'm particularly passionate about mentoring junior developers and sharing knowledge with colleagues.

My technical foundation includes 20 years of experience operating Linux servers, mail servers, web servers, DNS servers, and various other services. I've embraced modern cloud technologies, container management, process automation with CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes cluster administration.

### Technical Focus Areas

My primary expertise lies in web application development and system architecture, with particular strength in:
- .NET/C#
- Angular
- OAuth2/OpenID Connect
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- AI and Generative Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design
- Event-Driven Architectures, Messaging, Kafka

I prefer working with JetBrains products like Rider, WebStorm, and DataGrip, though I'm equally comfortable with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. While AI tools like Cursor and Copilot have significantly boosted my productivity, I firmly believe in mastering the fundamental concepts of software development. In my view, solid software architecture is increasingly crucial for project longevity and data security.

In professional contexts, I quickly grasp and optimize processes across various domains. My experience spans energy supply, logistics, IoT, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, financial services, and stock exchanges.

## My Services

### Software Architecture

Pragmatic, maintainable architectures using Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design for long-term successful solutions.

### IoT Platforms

Scalable platforms for industrial and energy sectors with real-time data processing and cloud integration.

### Cloud & DevOps

Migration to the cloud, optimization of development processes, and automation with Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.

### Consulting and Software Development

I offer customized consulting and software development services directly at your location.

### Complete Projects

Throughout my years of collaboration with various colleagues and companies, I have built a network of experts and can support you in implementing entire projects and help you find suitable partners. This includes software development teams in Germany and the Philippines.

## In Brief

I collaborate with both large enterprises and startups, bringing my own ideas and experiences to each engagement. My technical versatility centers on .NET/C#, Angular, Kubernetes, and AI. While I prefer working primarily remotely (80%), I value in-person collaboration with clients and colleagues.
