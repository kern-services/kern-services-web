## The Problem

We did not have enough rooms in our house for every kid to have their own room - unless I gave up my office.

## The Solution

I decided to try out a mobile office, working from the parking space in front of our house or from the middle of nowhere in nature. The alternative to this would have been to rent a small office space, which would not have been more cost effective.

### The Setup

- A mobile home with a table that is big enough to work at and a layout that allows the front seats to be turned around to the table
- 2kWh battery including a 230V outlet and solar charger
- Small mobile solar panel
- 27" screen with wall mount, detachable for traveling
- Notebook stand, keyboard and mouse
- My MacBook Pro (with the M* chip, which is kind of critical for the setup because of its low power consumption)
- My mobile phone with a hotspot function and a Telekom unlimited flatrate (for 33â‚¬/month)

### Choosing the right car

The chairs in cars are sometimes even more comfortable than at least cheap office chairs (it was later that I found out that [an expensive office chair](https://www.designcabinet.de/bueromoebel/buerostuehle/aeron-remastered/) is worth every penny).
Therefore I decided to look for RVs with a layout that allows the front seats to be turned around to the table, such that the driver or the passenger seat can be used as the main office chair.
Turns out that this criteria already filters out many models, but there are still some options. Combined with some additional requirements, like having enough beds for 5 people, I settled on a used model of the [Adria Coral XL](https://de.adria-mobil.com/wohnmobile/coral-xl).

### Setting up the mobile office

Other than the wall mount, I did not need any modifications to the car so far. There may be some additional modifications like building a table with a modified layout and mounting system, but that will be done later.

Power Station: I needed to get started quickly, so instead of installing a 230V power converter and fixed battery, I bought a 2kWh battery that includes all the components in one unit. I did not do extensive research, but found a good deal for the [OUKITEL P2001](https://eu.oukitel.com/de/products/p2001-portable-power-station), which I am still happily using today.

Solar Panel: In the Summer when the sun is shining, it gets really hot really fast in the car. Therefore it is important to me to being able to park in the shade of trees or a building. A fixed solar panel would not produce any power in the shade, so I bought a small mobile solar panel with a 10m cable. This way I can park in the shade and place the solar panel in the sun to charge the battery.

Screen: I re-used the 27" screen that I already had at home and mounted it on the wall of the car with an arm that can be moved around. Surprisingly, the power consumption of the screen is not that high, so I can keep it running for a few workdays on the battery - but with the solar panel I don't even need to worry about that.
