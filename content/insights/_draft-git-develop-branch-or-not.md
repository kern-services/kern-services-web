In this article, I'll assume that you know what CI/CD is and why it is important.

The questions I want to answer for myself - and maybe for you - in this post are:

- Which git flow is the best?
- Should we have a develop branch or not?
- How do we deploy new versions to production?
- and more

What is infrastructure as code?
